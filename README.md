# Hello!ðŸ‘‹ I am Abdullah

I am a computer science and engineering (CSE) and mathematics student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). My areas of interest include performance engineering, operating systems, computer architecture, and security.

I have a good grasp of programming languages like freestanding C, C++, Python, Assembly (x86 and RISC-V), and System Verilog, as well as tools like Linux, Git, scikit-learn (sk-learn), PyTorch, and scipy.

I have relevant work and research experience in the fields of performance engineering and operating systems and have contributed to several projects in the past. [You can visit my website to get to know me more!](https://itsabdullah.dev)
